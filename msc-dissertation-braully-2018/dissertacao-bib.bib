abstract = {Given a graph G, a function f:V(G)→Z, and an initial 01-vertex-labelling c1:V(G)→0,1, we study an iterative 01-vertex-labelling process on G where in each round every vertex v never changes its label from 1 to 0, and changes its label from 0 to 1 if at least f(v) neighbours have label 1. Such processes model opinion/disease spreading or fault propagation and have been studied under names such as irreversible threshold/majority processes in a large variety of contexts. Our contributions concern computational aspects related to the minimum cardinality irr f(G) of sets of vertices with initial label 1 such that during the process on G all vertices eventually change their label to 1. Such sets are known as irreversible conversion sets, dynamic irreversible monopolies, or catastrophic fault patterns. Answering a question posed by Dreyer and Roberts [P.A. Dreyer Jr., F.S. Roberts, Irreversible k-threshold processes: graph-theoretical threshold models of the spread of disease and of opinion, Discrete Appl. Math. 157 (2009) 16151627], we prove a hardness result for irrf(G) where f(v)=2 for every v∈V(G). Furthermore, we describe a general reduction principle for irrf(G), which leads to efficient algorithms for graphs with simply structured blocks such as trees and chordal graphs. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This paper studies new complexity aspects of P3-convexity restricted to planar graphs with bounded maximum degree. More specifically, we are interested in identifying either a minimum P3-geodetic set or a minimum P3-hull set of such graphs, from which the whole vertex set of G is obtained either after one or sufficiently many iterations, respectively. Each iteration adds to a set S all vertices of V(G)$\backslash$S with at least two neighbors in S. In this paper it is shown that: a minimum P3-hull set of a graph G can be found in polynomial time when ??(G)???n(G)/c (for some constant c); deciding if there is a P3-hull set of size at most k in a given graph remains NP-complete even for planar graphs with maximum degree four; and, surprisingly as well as rather counterintuitively, it is NP-complete to decide if there is a P3-hull set of size at most k in a graph with maximum degree three, though one can determine a minimum P3-hull set in polynomial time not only for cubic graphs but also for graphs with minimum feedback vertex set of bounded size and no vertices of degree two. Concerning P3-geodetic sets, the problem of deciding if there is a P3-geodetic set of size at most k in a planar graph with maximum degree three is proved to be NP-complete. Finally, from a parameterized point of view, we observe that finding a P3-geodetic set of size at most k, where k is the parameter, is W[2]-hard; however, when considering the maximum degree as an additional parameter, this problem becomes fixed-parameter tractable.},

abstract = {We will consider models of the spread of disease or opinion through social networks, represented as graphs. In our models, vertices will be in one of two states, 1 ("infected") or 0 ("uninfected") and change of state will take place at discrete times. After describing several such models, we will concentrate on the model, called an irreversible k-threshold process, where a vertex enters state 1 if at least k of its neighbors are in state 1, and where a vertex never leaves state 1 once it is in it. We will seek sets of vertices with the property that, if they are in state 1 at the beginning, then eventually all vertices end up in state 1. Such vertex sets correspond to vertices that can be infected with a disease or opinion so as to guarantee saturation of the population with the disease or opinion. We will also discuss ways to "defend" against such saturating sets, for example by "vaccination" or designing network topologies. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

McKay asked in [J. Graph Theory, doi: 10.1002/jgt.22043] whether infinitely many planar cubic hypohamiltonian graphs of girth 5 exist. We settle this question affirmatively. The second author asked in [J. Graph Theory 79 (2015) 63--81] to find all orders for which almost hypohamiltonian graphs exist---we solve this problem as well. To this end, we present a specialised algorithm which generates complete sets of almost hypohamiltonian graphs for various orders. Furthermore, we show that the smallest cubic almost hypohamiltonian graphs have order 26. We also provide a lower bound for the order of the smallest planar almost hypohamiltonian graph and improve the upper bound for the order of the smallest planar almost hypohamiltonian graph containing a cubic vertex. Finally, we determine the smallest planar almost hypohamiltonian graphs of girth 5, both in the general and cubic case.},

abstract = {Using computational techniques we derive six new upper bounds on the classical two-color Ramsey numbers: R(3,10) {\textless}= 42, R(3,11) {\textless}= 50, R(3,13) {\textless}= 68, R(3,14) {\textless}= 77, R(3,15) {\textless}= 87, and R(3,16) {\textless}= 98. All of them are improvements by one over the previously best known bounds. Let e(3,k,n) denote the minimum number of edges in any triangle-free graph on n vertices without independent sets of order k. The new upper bounds on R(3,k) are obtained by completing the computation of the exact values of e(3,k,n) for all n with k {\textless}= 9 and for all n {\textless}= 33 for k = 10, and by establishing new lower bounds on e(3,k,n) for most of the open cases for 10 {\textless}= k {\textless}= 15. The enumeration of all graphs witnessing the values of e(3,k,n) is completed for all cases with k {\textless}= 9. We prove that the known critical graph for R(3,9) on 35 vertices is unique up to isomorphism. For the case of R(3,10), first we establish that R(3,10) = 43 if and only if e(3,10,42) = 189, or equivalently, that if R(3,10) = 43 then every critical graph is regular of degree 9. Then, using computations, we disprove the existence of the latter, and thus show that R(3,10) {\textless}= 42.},

AMS Classification Number: 05E99 1. Moore Graphs We define a Moore Graph to be a graph with diameter d and girth 2d + 1. Somewhat surprisingly, any such graph must necessarily be regular (see [42]) and, given this, it is not hard to show that any Moore graph is distance regular. The complete graphs and odd cycles are trivial examples of Moore graphs. The Petersen and Hoffman-Singleton graphs are non-trivial examples. These examples were found by Hoffman and Singleton [23], where they showed that if X is a k-regular Moore graph with diameter two then k ∈ {\{}2, 3, 7, 57{\}}. This immediately raises the following question:},

abstract = {High performance graph analytics are critical for a long list of application domains. In recent years, the rapid advance- ment of many-core processors, in particular graphical pro- cessing units (GPUs), has sparked a broad interest in devel- oping high performance parallel graph programs on these ar- chitectures. However, the SIMT architecture used in GPUs places particular constraints on both the design and imple- mentation of the algorithms and data structures, making the development of such programs difficult and time-consuming. We present MapGraph, a high performance parallel graph programming framework that delivers up to 3 billion Tra- versed Edges Per Second (TEPS) on a GPU. MapGraph provides a high-level abstraction that makes it easy to write graph programs and obtain good parallel speedups on GPUs. To deliver high performance, MapGraph dynamically chooses among different scheduling strategies depending on the size of the frontier and the size of the adjacency lists for the vertices in the frontier. In addition, a Structure Of Arrays (SOA) pattern is used to ensure coalesced memory access. Our experiments show that, for many graph analytics algo- rithms, an implementation, with our abstraction, is up to two orders of magnitude faster than a parallel CPU imple- mentation and is comparable to state-of-the-art, manually optimized GPU implementations. In addition, with our ab- straction, new graph analytics can be developed with rela- tively little effort.},

It has been known that such a graph cannot be vertex-transitive. Also, certain restrictions on the structure of the automorphism group of such a graph have been known in the case when the order of the group is even. In this paper we further investigate symmetries and structural properties of the missing Moore (57, 2)-graph(s) with the help of a combination of spectral, group-theoretic, combinatorial, and computational methods. One of the consequences is that the order of the automorphism group of such a graph is at most 375. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The degree/diameter problem is to determine the largest graphs or digraphs of given maximum degree and given diameter. General upper bounds - called Moore bounds - for the order of such graphs and digraphs are attainable only for certain special graphs and digraphs. Finding better (tighter) upper bounds for the maxi- mum possible number of vertices, given the other two parameters, and thus attack- ing the degree/diameter problem `from above', remains a largely unexplored area. Constructions producing large graphs and digraphs of given degree and diameter represent a way of attacking the degree/diameter problem `from below'. This sur- vey aims to give an overview of the current state-of-the-art of the degree/diameter problem. We focus mainly on the above two streams of research. However, we could not resist mentioning also results on various related problems. These include considering Moore-like bounds for special types of graphs and digraphs, such as vertex-transitive, Cayley, planar, bipartite, and many others, on the one hand, and related properties such as connectivity, regularity, and surface embeddability, on the other hand.},

In graph-based applications, a systematic exploration of the graph such as a breadth-first search (BFS) often serves as a key component in the processing of their massive data sets. In this paper, we present a new method for implementing the parallel BFS algorithm on multi-core CPUs which exploits a fundamental property of randomly shaped real-world graph instances. By utilizing memory bandwidth more efficiently, our method shows improved performance over the current state-of-the-art implementation and increases its advantage as the size of the graph increases. We then propose a hybrid method which, for each level of the BFS algorithm, dynamically chooses the best implementation from: a sequential execution, two different methods of multicore execution, and a GPU execution. Such a hybrid approach provides the best performance for each graph size while avoiding poor worst-case performance on high-diameter graphs. Finally, we study the effects of the underlying architecture on BFS performance by comparing multiple CPU and GPU systems, a high-end GPU system performed as well as a quad-socket high-end CPU system.},

abstract = {Graphs are powerful data representations favored in many computational domains. Modern GPUs have recently shown promising results in accelerating computationally challenging graph problems but their performance suffered heavily when the graph structure is highly irregular, as most real-world graphs tend to be. In this study, we first observe that the poor performance is caused by work imbalance and is an artifact of a discrepancy between the GPU programming model and the underlying GPU architecture.We then propose a novel virtual warp-centric programming method that exposes the traits of underlying GPU architectures to users. Our method significantly improves the performance of applications with heavily imbalanced workloads, and enables trade-offs between workload imbalance and ALU underutilization for fine-tuning the performance. Our evaluation reveals that our method exhibits up to 9x speedup over previous GPU algorithms and 12x over single thread CPU execution on irregular graphs. When properly configured, it also yields up to 30{\%} improvement over previous GPU algorithms on regular graphs. In addition to performance gains on graph algorithms, our programming method achieves 1.3x to 15.1x speedup on a set of GPU benchmark applications. Our study also confirms that the performance gap between GPUs and other multi-threaded CPU graph implementations is primarily due to the large difference in memory bandwidth.},

@article{Merrill2012,
abstract = {Breadth-first search (BFS) is a core primitive for graph traversal and a basis for many higher-level graph analysis algorithms. It is also representative of a class of parallel computations whose memory accesses and work distribution are both irregular and data-dependent. Recent work has demonstrated the plausibility of GPU sparse graph traversal, but has tended to focus on asymptotically inefficient algorithms that perform poorly on graphs with non-trivial diameter. We present a BFS parallelization focused on fine-grained task management constructed from efficient prefix sum that achieves an asymptotically optimal O(|V|+|E|) work complexity. Our implementation delivers excellent performance on diverse graphs, achieving traversal rates in excess of 3.3 billion and 8.3 billion traversed edges per second using single and quad-GPU configurations, respectively. This level of performance is several times faster than state-of-the-art implementations both CPU and GPU platforms.},
